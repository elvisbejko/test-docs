## Geometry

All wires in `SpidaCalc` are directional, they originate from a given `ref` pole and terminate in a `wep`: a wire endpoint.

It is advantageous to imagine the `wep` as the entire structure *on* which the `wep` terminates. For example,
both `wep#1` and `wep#2` refer to the poles on the left and on the right of the `ref` respectively.
